def make_pc_features(ops, spike_templates, spike_clusters, tF):
    '''Get PC Features and corresponding indices for export to Phy.

    NOTE: This function will update tF in-place!

    Parameters
    ----------
    ops : dict
        Dictionary of state variables updated throughout the sorting process.
        This function is intended to be used with the final state of ops, after
        all sorting has finished.
    spike_templates : np.ndarray
        Vector of template ids with shape `(n_spikes,)`. This is equivalent to
        `st[:,1]`, where `st` is returned by `template_matching.extract`.
    spike_clusters : np.ndarray
        Vector of cluster ids with shape `(n_pikes,)`. This is equivalent to
        `clu` returned by `template_matching.merging_function`.
    tF : torch.Tensor
        Tensor of pc features as returned by `template_matching.extract`,
        with shape `(n_spikes, nearest_chans, n_pcs)`.

    Returns
    -------
    tF : torch.Tensor
        As above, but with some data replaced so that features are associated 
        with the final clusters instead of templates. The second and third
        dimensions are also swapped to conform to the shape expected by Phy.
    feature_ind : np.ndarray
        Channel indices associated with the data present in tF for each cluster,
        with shape `(n_clusters, nearest_chans)`.
