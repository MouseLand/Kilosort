We made some scripts to generate artificial data with similar statistics to real recordings. Run master_eMouse to verify that Kilosort has been installed correctly, as well as to understand how the various options are being passed in and used, and what you should be seeing in Phy after running Kilosort on your own data. This example has been made intentionally hard, so that the are still some clustering errors which you can visualize (and correct for!) in Phy. 

The scripts also measure the accuracy of the algorithm at two different stages (before and after the AUTO merges). The accuracy is measured both in terms of the clusters found by Kilosort, and in terms of the best achievable accuracy after merging those clusters optimally (with knowledge of the ground truth). The last set of results is supposed to mimic the kind of results you would get if you were only doing merges in Phy, and you knew exactly what merges are best.
