### eMouse simulator with drift ###

This simulator is an adaptation of the original eMouse simulator that accompanied Kilosort 1. The current version adds simulation of probe drift. The waveforms at arbitrary points on the probe are estimated using simple interpolation of measured waveforms from "oversampled" measurments. Waveforms for small neurons in this example are drawn from a striatum recording in the Kampff lab Ultradense Survey [1], analyzed by Susu Chen and Nick Steinmetz [2]. Waveforms for large neurons are taken from recordings in midbrain peformed by Susu Chen using an imec 3A probe.

For more information about how to run the simulator, go to the [eMouse wiki page](https://github.com/MouseLand/Kilosort2/wiki/4.-eMouse-simulator-with-drift).
